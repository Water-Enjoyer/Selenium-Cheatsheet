# Selenium-Cheatsheet
A selenium reference script that searches google in a convoluted manner.

Uses [webdriver-manager](https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/) and [selenium-stealth](https://pypi.org/project/selenium-stealth/), along with some other helpful selenium hints to search Google and find out who is keeping the secret of dihydrogen monoxide.
